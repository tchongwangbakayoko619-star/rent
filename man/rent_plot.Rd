\title{Visualize Rent's Rule and the Fitted Model}
\usage{
rent_plot(G, P, fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Numeric vector. Number of logic blocks in the circuit.}

\item{P}{Numeric vector. Observed number of external pins.}

\item{fit}{A list returned by \code{rent_fit()}, containing the estimated
parameters and the underlying linear model.}
}
\value{
A base R plot is produced as a side effect. The function returns
  \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function produces a log–log plot of the observed data \code{(G, P)}
together with the fitted Rent's rule model obtained from \code{rent_fit()}.
It provides a quick visual assessment of how well the estimated parameters
\eqn{k} and \eqn{p} capture the empirical relationship between logic blocks
and external pins.
}
\details{
The plot displays:
\itemize{
  \item the observed data points in the \eqn{\log(G)}–\eqn{\log(P)} space,
  \item the regression line corresponding to the fitted model.
}

This visualization is useful for:
\itemize{
  \item validating the linearity assumption of the log–log transformation,
  \item checking the goodness of fit,
  \item detecting potential outliers or deviations from Rent's rule.
}
}
\examples{
G <- c(1e4, 2e4, 5e4, 1e5)
P <- c(800, 1200, 2000, 3000)
fit <- rent_fit(G, P)
rent_plot(G, P, fit)
