\title{Estimate Rent's Rule Parameters (k and p)}
\usage{
rent_fit(G, P)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Numeric vector. Number of logic blocks in the circuit.
Must be strictly positive.}

\item{P}{Numeric vector. Observed number of external pins corresponding
to each value of \code{G}. Must be strictly positive.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
  \item{k}{Estimated proportionality constant of Rent's rule.}
  \item{p}{Estimated Rent exponent, describing interconnection complexity.}
  \item{model}{The fitted linear model object returned by \code{lm()}.}
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the two parameters of **Rent's rule** — the
proportionality constant \eqn{k} and the Rent exponent \eqn{p} — from
observed data. Rent's rule models the relationship between the number of
logic blocks in a circuit and the number of external pins required:
}
\details{
\deqn{P = k \cdot G^{p}}

Taking the logarithm of both variables yields a linear relationship:

\deqn{\log(P) = \log(k) + p \cdot \log(G)}

This function fits this linearized form using ordinary least squares
regression. The slope of the regression corresponds to the Rent exponent
\eqn{p}, and the intercept corresponds to \eqn{\log(k)}, from which
\eqn{k} is recovered by exponentiation.


The estimation assumes:
\itemize{
  \item a power-law relationship between \code{G} and \code{P},
  \item log-normal noise in the observations,
  \item linearity of \eqn{\log(P)} with respect to \eqn{\log(G)}.
}

The function is vectorized and will estimate parameters from all provided
data points simultaneously.
