\title{Compute the Number of External Pins Using Rent's Rule}
\usage{
rent_pins(G, k, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{Numeric vector. Number of logic blocks in the circuit.}

\item{k}{Numeric scalar. Proportionality constant of Rent's rule.}

\item{p}{Numeric scalar. Rent's exponent, controlling interconnection complexity.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector giving the estimated number of external pins
  corresponding to each value of \code{G}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the expected number of external pins required
for a digital circuit based on **Rent's rule**, a widely used empirical
model in microelectronics and VLSI design.
}
\details{
Rent's rule expresses the relationship between the number of logic blocks
in a system and the number of external connections (pins) needed to
interface with the rest of the circuit. It is commonly used to estimate
interconnection complexity, guide packaging decisions, and support early
architectural planning.

The rule is defined as:
\deqn{P = k \cdot G^{p}}
where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{P} is the number of external pins,
  \item \eqn{k} is a proportionality constant related to the architecture,
  \item \eqn{G} is the number of logic blocks,
  \item \eqn{p} is Rent's exponent, typically between 0 and 1.
}
}
\examples{
# Basic usage
rent_pins(G = 10000, k = 4.5, p = 0.6)

# Vectorized input
rent_pins(G = c(1e4, 2e4, 5e4), k = 4.5, p = 0.6)
