# rent: Modeling Interconnection Complexity with Rent's Rule

The **rent** package provides tools to model and analyze interconnection
complexity in digital circuits using **Rent's rule**, a well‑established
empirical law in microelectronics and VLSI design.  
It offers simple and intuitive functions to estimate Rent parameters,
predict pin counts, and visualize the log–log relationship between logic
blocks and external pins.
